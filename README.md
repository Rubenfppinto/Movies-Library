Movies library <br>

<strong>What is does? </strong><br>
The application is a wikipedia of movie. The user can access the website by signing up/in and once inside the application they can navigate through a list of movies and directors.<br>

The user have the option to see more information about one specific movie which includes a link to the director that produced the film, or they can see a specific director which will also link to the list of movies they have produced.<br>

<strong>Struggles: </strong><br>
The project was very challenging from start to end. I started with a clear idea of what I wanted to do, to then later realise that it was a much bigger job for the timeframe I had. I had to accomodate my application to a simple version to begin with and leave some of the features for a second sprint.

Deploying the project was also a big challenge, because I had never done it before. After a lot research I was able to host the application online, but it wouldn't work because of the database. Having heroku accessing the database was the biggest struggle of the deployement but with more research I overcame the challenge and realise that it was simpler than it looked.<br>

<strong>Sprint2 </strong><br>
- Add a seach bar on the homepage to search for movies and directors
- Show the username as login information instead of email
- Add a Watched and To Watch list so the user can favourite films and directors<br>
